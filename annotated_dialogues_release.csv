1," Smythe: Did you call, sir?
Stew: Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.
Stew: Shhh! Do you hear something?
Smythe: Yes, sir.
Stew: You try it.
Smythe: Me, sir?
Stew: Yeah.
Stew: No, no. Give it more volume.
Stew: No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Smythe: No, sir!
Stew: Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Smythe: Yes, sir.
Stew: Found no skeletons?
Smythe: No, sir.
Stew: It's haunted just the same.
Smythe: Yes, sir.
Stew: Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Smythe: Well, sir, I putter.
Stew: Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Smythe: I just putter.
Stew: Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Smythe: Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Stew: Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Smythe: Well sir, I'll show you.
Smythe: That's puttering, sir.
Stew: No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Smythe: Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Stew: Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Smythe: Yes sir.
Stew: Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Smythe: Yes sir.
Stew: How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Smythe: You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Stew: Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why?
Smythe: Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place.
Stew: A bird in a gilded cage?
Smythe: Yes.

Longfellow: Oh. Oh!
Walter: Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Longfellow: She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride.

Walter: That's what the two policem√©n said, sir.
Longfellow: What two policemen?
Walter: The ones who brought you home, sir.
Longfellow: Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow calls up, tell him I'm not in. He may be a great author, but I think he's crazy. The man's crazy, Walter. ",Longfellow,Walter,Workplace Superior - Subordinate,Mr Deeds Goes to Town,Male,Male,0,White,White,sir

Longfellow: Please!
Walter: But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Walter: Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?

Susan: I work at Seligman's.

Potter: A friend of yours?

And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say...
George: Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was...

Potter: George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
George: Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Potter: The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side.  Young man, twenty- ",George,Potter,Opponents,It's a Wonderful Life,Male,Male,0,White,White,Mr.

Potter: Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man . who hates his job  who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped.  Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?
George: Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?
Potter: My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
George: Hire me?
Potter: I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
George: Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars a year?
Potter: You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
George: Would I?
Potter: Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
George: Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Potter: Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
George: Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just...  I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-
Potter: Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
George: I'd like to do that.
Potter: In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
George: All right, sir.
Potter: Okay, George?
George: Okay, Mr. Potter.
George: No... no... no... no, now wait a minute, here!  I don't have to talk to anybody!  I know right now, and the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it! ",George,Potter,Opponents,It's a Wonderful Life,Male,Male,0,White,White,"Mr., wife"

Potter: Oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?
George: The reporters?
Potter: Yes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you.
George: Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you please? Can't you see what it means to my family? I'll pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan...
Potter: George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?
George: No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere.
Potter: You misplaced eight thousand dollars?
George: Yes, sir.
Potter: Have you notified the police?
George: No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.
Potter: They're going to believe that one.
George: No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Potter: What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
George: What?
Potter: Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
George: I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Potter: Well, what about all your other friends?
George: They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Potter: I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
George: No, sir.
Potter: Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?
George: I have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy.

Bud: Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Dr. dreyfuss: Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Bud: Oh.
Dr. dreyfuss: Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Bud: Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Dr. dreyfuss: As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Bud: I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Dr. dreyfuss: Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.
Bud: Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc.
Dr. dreyfuss: You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Bud: Me?
Dr. dreyfuss: When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should --
Bud: My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.

Dr. dreyfuss: So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Bud: Something like that.
Dr. dreyfuss: You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Dr. dreyfuss: If you'd come home half an hour later, you would have had quite a Christmas present.

49," Dr. dreyfuss: She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Bud: Just as long as she's okay.
Dr. dreyfuss: These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
Dr. dreyfuss: Any of that coffee left?
Bud: Sure.
Dr. dreyfuss: How do you spell her last name?
Bud: Kubelik -- with two k's.
Dr. dreyfuss: What's her address?
Bud: Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
Dr. dreyfuss: It's regulations.
Bud: She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- ",Bud,Dr. dreyfuss,Neighbors,The Apartment,Male,Male,1,White,White,Bud and Baxter are inconsistent

Dr. dreyfuss: Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.
Bud: Help yourself.
Bud: I'm not sure.
Dr. dreyfuss: A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --

Bud: I sort of like it.
Fran: Say, you got a lulu.
Bud: Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Fran: Oh, I never catch colds.
Bud: Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Fran: That makes me feel just terrible.
Bud: Why?
Fran: Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Bud: That's me.

Fran: It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Bud: Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?

Bud: What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --
Fran: So I see.

Bud: Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Fran: I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Bud: I forgive you.
Fran: You shouldn't.
Bud: You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Fran: Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Bud: Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. ",Bud,Fran,Lovers,The Apartment,Male,Female,0,White,White,"Girl Scout, Fran might be addressed as ""Miss Kubelik"""

Fran: How many of those drinks did you have?
Bud: Three.

Bud: Miss Kubelik, I would like your honest opinion. I've had this in my desk for a week -- cost me fifteen dollars -- but I just couldn't get up enough nerve to wear it --
Bud: It's what they call the junior executive model. What do you think?
Bud: Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Fran: No -- I like it.
Bud: Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Fran: Of course not.
Bud: Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --
Fran: Much better.
Bud: Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Fran: This is a bad day for me.
Bud: I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --

Bud: A bad insurance risk?
Fran: That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

Fran: Was he really upset when you told him?
Bud: Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.

Bud: I'm sure that's the explanation.

Fran: As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Bud: Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Fran: Why not?

Fran: Yes, you are... When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
Bud: It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
Fran: You mean to someone like Mr.

Fran: No, I don't.

Fran: That's terrible.
Bud: Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.

Melanie: Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit.      I know about you too.
Ben: You do?

Ben: Please, call me Ben.
Melanie: All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so depressed? You really expect a different verdict?
Ben: Why do you ask? Can you understand it?
Melanie: Of course I understand it. What could they have. I'm not cynical.
Ben: Tell me, Miss Bruwer...
Melanie: Ben and Melanie, that's fair.
Ben: Tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice?
Melanie: I'll never stop believing. But in this country I've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations.
Ben: What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations? ",Ben,Melanie,Friends,"Dry White Season, A",Male,Female,0,White,White,"Mr. Du toit, one is clear"
334," Ben: Why?   You didn't write it.
Melanie: I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush.
Ben: No.
Melanie: So what happened? I can imagine.
Ben: A distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer Du Toit is a leper. That's why I called on you the other day, I needed to talk to somebody rational.
Melanie: Thanks for the compliment. But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them. In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor.
Ben: You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal English paper?
Melanie: My mother was a foreigner, I'm not pure, wragte Afrikaner. They don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you.
Ben: What kind of loyalty? Blind loyalty. Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all the loyalty I could give, laager loyalty. You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains.

336," Ben: What about you?
Melanie: What?
Ben: I mean not married...
Melanie: And living in this chaos with my eccentric father? I love him and we get on perfectly. We have been together since I was a year old. My mother could not adapt to South Africa. She went back to London and we've never heard from her since.
Ben: Being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that?
Melanie: Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic mother. In fact she had two families, me and her three children in Alexandra township.
Ben: And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. Why a journalist?
Melanie: Sometimes I ask myself the same question. ",Ben,Melanie,Friends,"Dry White Season, A",Male,Female,0,White,White,this little girl
337," Ben: About what?
Melanie: Then I married my ex-teacher.
Ben: Oh.   He must have been young.
Melanie: Fifteen years difference. He too protected me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.
Ben: Go on.
Melanie: That made me think that I was a parasite, something white and maggot-like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic.
Ben: And then you became a journalist? ",Ben,Melanie,Friends,"Dry White Season, A",Male,Female,1,White,White,"he must have been young"" reveals that Melanie is female if we consider only hetro-sexual marriage"
338," Ben: Did it work?
Melanie: I wish I could give you a straight answer. What did help me was my wanderings in Africa.
Ben: How did you manage that on a South African passport? We South Africans are white devils in Africa.
Melanie: My mother was English, remember?
Ben: You really are your father's daughter!
Melanie: I wonder what he's doing right now. Most likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever.
Ben: How often does he go on these trips to the veldt?
Melanie: It depends -- ",Ben,Melanie,Friends,"Dry White Season, A",Male,Female,0,White,White,father's daughter
339," Ben: That's the main reason for coming here tonight. Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad.
Melanie: And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press.
Ben: You know, Melanie, I'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto.
Melanie: We better win before the blacks have won.
Ben: Now, before going to the press, I have to have all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia.
Melanie: Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia... ",Ben,Melanie,Friends,"Dry White Season, A",Male,Female,1,White,White,"could be figured from name, but the name could easily be replaced with another as everything else is gender neutral"

Jim: We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
Bill: And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Jim: I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.
Bill: He had his palm print on the weapon.

It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman...

Jim: I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam.
Bill: Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Jim: If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?

He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.

Rath: The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Electra: They tried to kill you?
Rath: Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Electra: Then you went freelance?
Rath: The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Electra: Tell me about the first time.
Rath: My first take?
Electra: Yes.
Rath: Why?
Electra: Because I want to know.
Rath: It was... mechanical.  Very precise.

Rath: No.  Just the first one.

Rath: They become complicated... messy.
Electra: Did it ever bother you?
Rath: Did it ever bother James Bond?

Electra: Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Rath: You get a job swinging a hammer, the first day you get a blister, it tears open, it bleeds and it stays sore a long time.  You keep swinging the hammer, you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again.

Rath: Then, we wait.
Electra: Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Rath: It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
Rath: The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Electra: Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Rath: He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
Electra: What?  What if he brings it with him?
Rath: He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
Electra: That means you won't have a gun.
Rath: That's right.
Electra: And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Rath: If things go well, I don't have to.
Electra: You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Rath: I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Electra: We split the money?
Rath: Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Electra: Sounds pretty well figured out.
Rath: I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Electra: Except --
Rath: What?
Electra: Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
Rath: I told you, he will.
Electra: You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Rath: I was.
Rath: Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
Electra: For Nicholai?
Rath: Yes.
Electra: You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
Electra: What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Rath: I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Electra: I don't believe that.
Rath: It wasn't planned or premeditated.
Electra: Ten years ago.
Rath: Yes.
Electra: What happened?
Rath: I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Electra: What did he want?
Rath: He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Rath: What did he say?
Rath: He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Electra: Was that it?
Rath: Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
Electra: You didn't take it.
Rath: No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Electra: Ten years later, here you are again.
Rath: Yes.  Here I am again. ",Electra,Rath,Friends,Assassins,Female,Male,1,White,White,

Rath: No.
Electra: I think I got one today.
Rath: Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
Electra: What do you suppose he's doing now?
Rath: Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Electra: I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Rath: They're worth less points.
Electra: So?
Electra: Do you hear them?
Electra: Listen.
Electra: Did you think they were newlyweds?
Rath: I didn't notice them.
Electra: When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Rath: How do you know they're not?
Electra: I went into their room this afternoon.
Rath: What?
Electra: It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Rath: Jesus, if someone had --
Electra: Nobody ever sees me.
Rath: Why in the hell would you take that chance?
Electra: I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Electra: She is married, but not to him.
Rath: Thank you.
Electra: Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Rath: No.
Electra: No?
Rath: It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Electra: I know.  It makes me crazy.
Rath: Why?
Electra: I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Rath: And you were drilling these holes...?
Electra: So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Rath: Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Electra: He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Rath: Did he explain how this happened?
Electra: He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father.
Rath: What are you doing?
Electra: What?
Rath: That's a ridiculous move.
Electra: Why?
Rath: Because, I'll take it.
Electra: I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move.
Electra: Can I ask you something?
Rath: I'm sure you will.
Electra: Am I attractive?
Rath: Yes.
Electra: Are you attracted to me?
Rath: Yes.
Electra: Why?
Rath: Why?  I don't know.
Electra: Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Rath: Both.
Electra: Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
Rath: I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Electra: Attraction is a complication?
Rath: It can be.
Electra: It happened to you before?
Rath: Yes.
Electra: Who was she?
Rath: Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Electra: What happened to her?
Rath: She was taken.
Electra: Did you --
Rath: No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Electra: Was she the only one?
Rath: After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without...
Electra: Is this becoming complicated?
Rath: I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Electra: Were you attracted to me right away?
Rath: No.
Electra: When did it start?
Rath: Honestly?
Electra: Uh-huh.
Rath: When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Electra: Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Rath: Why?
Electra: That doesn't sound normal.
Rath: I'm not normal.
