Emily: No, it can't. ",Emily,Kane,1
15," Emily: There seems to be only one decision you can make, Charles.  I'd say that it has been made for you.
Kane: Have you gone completely mad, Emily?
Kane: You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Emily: I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Kane: Oh, they'll publish it all right. ",Emily,Kane,1
16," Kane: Oh yes, there is.

Kane: I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
Susan: No.  They've passed on.
Kane: Where's the soap?
Susan: In the water.
Susan: I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
Susan: Oh!
Kane: I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Susan: I know...  But you do look so silly.
Kane: Where's the towel?
Susan: On the chiffonier.  Here.

Susan: Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Susan: I work at Seligman's.
Kane: Is that what you want to do?
Susan: I want to be a singer.
Kane: What happened to the singing?

24," Kane: One thing I've never been able to understand, Susan.  How do you know you haven't done them before?
Susan: It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Kane: You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
Susan: It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Kane: I was referring to myself. ",Kane,Susan,1
26," Kane: Susan, I really think -
Susan: Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything.  You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.

Susan: Well, I'm not going to stop it. ",Kane,Susan,1

Nancy: Glen.  Not now.  I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Glen: Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Nancy: Because he was scary, that's why.
Glen: Who was scary?
Nancy: Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same guy?
Glen: Me?  I don't dream. ",Glen,Nancy,1

Nancy: Burned myself in Englsh class.
Nancy: M'god, I look twenty years old.
Glen: Slept like a rock.
Nancy: Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.
Glen: No.
Nancy: You believe in the Boogey Man?
Glen: One two, Freddie's coming for you?  No.  Rod killed Tina.
Nancy: You believe in anything?
Glen: I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll.  And I'm not too sure about you lately.

Glen: Uh-oh...
Nancy: It's nothing too hard or anything.
Nancy: Okay?
Glen: Okay, okay.
Nancy: You won't screw up, right?  I mean, a whole lot might depend on it.

Glen: You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Nancy: No.
Glen: They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'.  So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
Nancy: Yeah.
Glen: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.
Nancy: And what if they meet a monster in their dream?  Then what?
Glen: They turn their back on it.
Nancy: What happens if they don't do that?
Glen: I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Nancy: Great.
Nancy: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Glen: Well what you reading it for?
Nancy: I'm into survival.
Glen: She's starting to scare the living shit out of me. ",Glen,Nancy,1

Nancy: Fine.  Stand by your window so I can see you.  You sound a million miles away.
Nancy: Much better.
Glen: I heard your ma went ape at the security store today.  You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something.  How long's it been since you slept?
Nancy: Coming up on the seventh day.  It's okay, I checked Guiness.  The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.
Glen: Who?
Nancy: The killer.
Glen: You do?
Nancy: Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
Glen: Me!?  Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Nancy: Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
Glen: Bring him out of what?
Nancy: My dream.
Glen: How you plan to do that?
Nancy: Just like I did the hat.  Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
Glen: Me?
Nancy: If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Glen: I can save you the trouble.
Nancy: Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Glen: What!?
Nancy: You heard me.  I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up.  We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him.  Clever, huh?
Glen: You crazy?  Hit him with what?
Nancy: You're a jock.  You must have a baseball bat or something.

Sandy: Am I bothering you?
Jeffrey: No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Sandy: Yes.
Jeffrey: How is Central these days?
Sandy: Terrible. boring.
Jeffrey: What else is new?. right?
Sandy: Yeah. What are you doing now?
Jeffrey: I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Sandy: That's too bad.
Jeffrey: What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Sandy: Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Jeffrey: Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Sandy: I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown.
Jeffrey: Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Sandy: There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Jeffrey: Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Sandy: No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
Jeffrey: The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Sandy: Maybe so.
Jeffrey: It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Sandy: Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy.
Jeffrey: I guess you have to get back home soon?
Sandy: Not really, why? ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
251," Sandy: That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Jeffrey: Where are they?

Jeffrey: Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Sandy: I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Jeffrey: Oh yeah. What about those other people?
Sandy: My father is watching the businessman.
Jeffrey: You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Sandy: Yeah, I guess so.
Jeffrey: I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Sandy: Still, it must be kinda rough.
Jeffrey: It's not bad. but it's bad enough.

Sandy: Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
254," Sandy: Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Jeffrey: There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk.
Sandy: You said it was a strange world.
Jeffrey: Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help.
Jeffrey: Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Sandy: Now, how are you going to do that?
Jeffrey: Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Sandy: What will I say when she comes to the door?
Jeffrey: You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few 'Awake' magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Sandy: I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Jeffrey: Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Sandy: You've got a point there. ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
255," Jeffrey: Let's go.
Jeffrey: Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?

Sandy: Alright. Good luck, yourself. ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1

Jeffrey: Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
Jeffrey: Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Sandy: No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Jeffrey: I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.
Sandy: Yeah, if it opens the door.
Jeffrey: Yeah. ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
258," Sandy: You really want to do this, don't you?
Jeffrey: I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Jeffrey: First of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
Sandy: I already know. The 'Slow Club.' It's on Route 7.
Jeffrey: Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Sandy: Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Jeffrey: Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Jeffrey: See ya! ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
259," Sandy: What's the plan.
Jeffrey: First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Sandy: Brilliant.
Jeffrey: Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Sandy: This is not my usual Friday night! ",Jeffrey,Sandy,1
260," Sandy: Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Jeffrey: Why not?
Sandy: It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.

Sandy: Yeah. but.
Jeffrey: Leave it in the front of your house for me.
Sandy: O.K.
Jeffrey: Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Jeffrey: I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

Jeffrey: Yeah.
Sandy: I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Jeffrey: Are you sure?
Sandy: I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
Jeffrey: Okay. thanks.
Sandy: I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Jeffrey: That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?

Loretta: And you're not now?
Loretta: Why not?
Ronny: I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.

Ed: But you don't think his momma'll be upset? I mean overly?
Hi: Well a course she'll be upset, sugar, but she'll get over it. She's got four little babies almost as good as this one. It's like when I was robbin' convenience stores -

Hi: Well, factually, I myself bear a very large-
Ed: Lemme finish. Since those jailbirds took little Nathan I been doin' some thinking, and I ain't too proud of myself. Even if Mrs. Arizona had more'n she could handle, I was a police officer sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States -
Hi: Now waitaminute honey, you resigned before we-
Ed: That ain't the point, Hi. We don't deserve Nathan Jr. Any more'n those jailbirds do. And if I'm as selfish and irresponsible as you-
